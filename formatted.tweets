.Masks and alt aware aligners reduce incidence of ambiguous alignments when aligning reads to full assembly 
.Anchor sequences that are present in primary assembly and alt loci affect short read mappers.

.Alternate loci are NOT haplotypes--can have haplotype switching in an alt locus.

Huh. I never thought to do that. People are weird.
Context?
.Ew
.But...but...MAGIC!
 Agree + only tested 2 KIR genes. LD leads to inference about others
I have to publicly shout out my best cheerleaders that also read my work w a critical eye. You rock! 
.The GRC will certainly focus on it for improving the reference assembly further.
Imputation is likely to perform well for non-European populations provided good reference data is available
.Interesting. I would argue we do not yet know the full spectrum of haplotypes (i.e. not everyone is EUR)
.Some evidence here in discussion: 
.YES!
.There is so much SV shuffling at these loci (why there are so many seq reps) that tagging a whole hap would be diff.
See myfrom 
.We found that most IGH structural variants were poorly tagged by GWAS SNPs. Similar complexity of haplotypes.
.But that is just one phenotype. I would not rule out all autoimmune disorders.
.Not sure there would be tag SNPs for such a complex loci. Even more haplotypes than MHC.
.Almost certainly poor interrogation--highly complex. 35 sequence representations in GRCh38. 
 You don't say? No AgilentV5 in our data here though. 
He has an app for that.
